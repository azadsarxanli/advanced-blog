# instructions:

- To use this app, `fork` it or, just `clone`. Open the folder that you cloned in your IDE
- Open the terminal - in `visual studio code` terminal is built on top of Windows Terminal (or you can use ctrl + ` )
- on terminal write `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- after that, you can run the app by typing `npm start`
- open another terminal - I recommend that you should use `cmd` terminal or another, but absolutely not `powershell`
- in this new terminal write `npm i json-server` and after that run `json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3001`
  **Congratulations!** You have successfully run the app.
